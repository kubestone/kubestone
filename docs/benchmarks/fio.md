# Fio - Flexible I/O tester

!!! quote
    fio is a tool that will spawn a number of threads or processes doing a particular type of I/O action as specified by the user.  The typical use of  fio  is  to  write  a  job  file matching the I/O load one wants to simulate. 

With the [fio](https://fio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fio_doc.html) benchmark you can measure the I/O performance of the disks used in your Kubernetes cluster. 



## Mode of operation

Kubestone generates a Kubernetes Job from each fio CR that will run a single pod with the defined fio job.

When `customJobFiles` are specified in the CR a ConfigMap will be created to held the content of the job files. The entries in the ConfigMap named using the following pattern: `customJobN`, where N is the item in the customJobFiles list.

If `PersistentVolumeClaim` is provided in the CR the respective PVC will be used for benchmarking.

!!! warning
    If the PersistentVolumeClaim is not specified, Docker's layered fs performance will be measured



## Example configuration
You can find [configuration examples](https://github.com/xridge/kubestone/tree/master/config/samples/fio) in the GitHub repository.



## Sample benchmark
To run a sample benchmark with PVC mode, the following command can be used:
```bash
$ kustomize build github.com/xridge/kubestone/config/samples/fio/overlays/pvc | kubectl create --namespace kubestone -f -
```

Please refer to the [quickstart guide](../quickstart.md) for further details.




## Fio Configuration

The complete documentation of fio CR can be found in the [API Docs](../apidocs.md#perf.kubestone.xridge.io/v1alpha1.FioSpec).
