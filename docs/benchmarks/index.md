# Kubestone Benchmarks

Kubestone leverages Open Source benchmarks to measure Core Kubernetes and Application performance.

As benchmarks are executed in Kubernetes, they must be containerized to work on the cluster. A certified set of benchmark containers are provided via [xridge's DockerHub space](https://hub.docker.com/r/xridge/).
