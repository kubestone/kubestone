# SysBench - Scriptable database and system performance benchmark 

!!! quote
    sysbench is a scriptable multi-threaded benchmark tool based on LuaJIT. It is most frequently used for database benchmarks, but can also be used to create arbitrarily complex workloads that do not involve a database server. 

With the [sysbench](https://github.com/akopytov/sysbench) benchmark you can measure the CPU, Memory, Database and Filesystem characteritics of your Kubernetes cluster.
