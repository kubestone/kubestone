# Kubestone

Kubestone is a benchmarking [Operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) that can evaluate the performance of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) installations. 



## Features

- **Supports common set of benchmarks** to measure:
  CPU, Disk, Network and Application performance
- **Fine-grained control over Kubernetes Scheduling primitives**:
  Affinity, Anti-Affinity, Tolerations, Storage Classes and Node Selection  
- **Cloud Native**: 
  Benchmarks runs are defined as Custom Resources and executed in the cluster using Kubernetes resources: Pods, Jobs, Deployments and Services.
- **Extensible**: 
  New benchmarks can easily be added by implementing a new controller. 



## Benchmarks
